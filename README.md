# Description:
This blocks urls. Since some websites can have a www. prefix to them, this blocks those urls as well. To block the entire site make sure the url has no prefix on it (e.g. "google.com" NOT "http://google.com") Also make sure there is no www. prefix ( e.g. facebook.com NOT "www.facebook.com")

# Usage:
node .add_file_to_hosts.js [url]

folde_name\Smith, Joe - 0AAA119SP00134\Revision 1 - Late\student_submission.extension  

This has been tested on Windows 7 running the following version of cygwin with the linux diff utility installed:  
C:\Windows\SysWOW64>uname -r
2.10.0(0.325/5/3)

## Instructions
Change the following line in the program to change the minimum lines difference an assignment can have before it is flaged as copied:  
const diff_line_minimum = 20;

Change the following line in the program to change the list of file extensions the program compares:  
const extensions = ['.java','rtf','.txt'];

The program will write a file called: "output_diffs" and will notify you when it finds a group with console.log in stdout. 

## Usage: 
node compare_files.js [schoology folder]


# add_file_to_hosts.js
## Description:
This blocks urls. Since some websites can have a www. prefix to them, this blocks those urls as well. To block the entire site make sure the url has no prefix on it (e.g. "google.com" NOT "http://google.com") Also make sure there is no www. prefix ( e.g. facebook.com NOT "www.facebook.com")

## Usage:
node add_file_to_hosts.js [url]
